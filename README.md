# hookd

Consume return values from arbitrary Java methods in Clojure.

## Installation

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/com.github.ivarref/hookd.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.github.ivarref/hookd)

## Example usage

Make sure your JVM is started with `-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true`.

```clojure
(require '[com.github.ivarref.hookd :as hookd])

; I want to get a copy of the Apache Tomcat JDBC pool:
(defonce conn-pool (atom nil))

(hookd/install-return-consumer!
  "org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.ConnectionPool"
  "::Constructor" ; Special method name to hook into the constructor(s)
  (partial reset! conn-pool))

; I want to peek at connections returned from the connection pool:
(hookd/install-return-consumer!
  "org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.ConnectionPool"
  "getConnection"
  (fn [conn] ...))
```

## How it works

`hookd` uses [java agents](https://www.baeldung.com/java-instrumentation)
to modify the bytecode of class files. It attaches itself to the running
JVM. Repeated calls for the same class and method combination
will not modify the bytecode, only replace the consumer function.
